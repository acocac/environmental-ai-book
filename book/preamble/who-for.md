# Who is the book for?

While the scientific community is broad, we think the target audience of this book is:
* Researchers with some background in environmental science interested in data-driven methods.
* Researchers with some background in computer science interested in environmental studies.  
* Anyone else interested in reproducibility, inclusive, shareable and collaborative AI and data science for environmental applications

The interactive code in the book is mostly written in Python. If you are not familiar with the Python language and its scientific packages, we strongly suggest following the [Pythia Foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html). This is a community learning resource for Python-based computing in the geoscience. We provide a dedicated section of resources with other useful initiatives covering computer vision and other data-driven methods.
