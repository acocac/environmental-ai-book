# About this book

_The Environmental AI_ book compiles research in the application of **AI** and **Data Science** for monitoring and modelling a wide diversity of settings of the natural and urban environments. 

Through a set of interactive use cases, the book aims to be a **living**, **free** and **open** document guiding the scientific community about information extraction and analysis from environmental sensors (including ground sensors, drones, and satellite Earth observations) and other type of data using data-driven methods. 

In addition to the book, our goal is to build a community dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research in the Environmental science. In this regard, we host online {ref}`Collaboration Cafes <cm-coworking-collabcafe>` which are a coworking space aiming to engage anyone interested in learning and discussing relevant themes in AI and data science to help understand our changing planet.
